							<h3>Agilent Technologies | Santa Clara, CA </h3>
							<h4>R&ampD Mechanical Engineering Intern</h4>
							<h4>June 2019 - September 2019</h4>
							<p>The group I worked with during this internship dealt with the Research and Development of ion sources within mass spectrometer technology. A brief introduction can be found <a href="https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/slidepresentation/public/5991-5857_Agilent_MS_Theory_EN.pdf">here</a>. Although ionization of particles is achievable, the physics behind it is still up for debate. As a result, research is still being conducted to better understand this phenomenon.</p>
							<p>I worked on two projects during my time at Agilent Technologies. The first was to design and build chamber for electrospray research. The second was to develop a testbench for heaters going into mass spectrometers.</p>
							<p>My first project was to design and build an isolated chamber that allows university researchers to easily use FTIR spectroscopy to understand the flow of ions out of an electrospray nozzle. I used <u>SolidWorks</u> to design a enclosure that is compatible with the existing electrospray nozzles used at Agilent. The design utilized Aluminum Extrusions, stainless steel parts, and Delrin plastic. These materials were chosen because of their strong resistance to corrosion, structural integrity, manufacturability, and ease of construction.</p>
							<p>My second project was to develop a test bench that is capable of validating and testing ceramic heaters. This testbench is used to alleviate a manufacturing bottleneck that was present. By being able to test multiple heaters in parallel with one another, manufacturing efficiency is increased. The testbench needed to quickly and safely bring the gas flow to user-set temperatures. The testbench uses a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), thermocouples, solid-state relays, and thermocouple modules from Wago. The PLC was coded in <u>Structured Text</u> and the heaters were controlled by a <u>PID controller</u>. The PLC from Wago had a built in datalogger that I could access via internet. In order to tune the PID controller, I used <u>Python</u> for data analysis. </p> 
							<p>One difficulty I had with this project was the fact that the system's transient response was in the range of minutes and I couldn't quickly run tests to finely tune the PID controller. Furthermore, the heat transfer between the ceramic heater and turbulent gas flow was highly irregular and nonlinear due to the shape of the enclosure. By testing how the system responds to different pulse width inputs to the heater, I was eventually able to manually tune the PID controller to produce a desired temperature response. I was also exposed to the use of Machine Learning for linear and nonlinear system identification and machine learning control. Both of which are areas strong areas of interest of mine.</p>

							<h3>Lam Research | Fremont, CA </h3>
							<h4>Engineering Intern</h4>
							<h4>June 2018 - September 2018</h4>
							<p>The group I worked with during this internship dealt with the Research and Development of silicon wafer cleaning technologies. In between etching and deposition steps of microfabrication of silicon wafers, the wafers need to be deeply cleaned to remove any impurities and deposits that may have been left behind. One issue that engineers at Lam had was that the water used to clean the wafers were leaving marks on the wafers.</p>
							<p>My project was create an powerful LED lighting system that was small enough yet powerful enough to illuminate the wafer for high-speed imaging. Using <u>Siemens NX</u> I was able to design a fixture for an LED along with its heatsink and manufacture it using a <u>CNC</u> and <u>Stereolithography 3D printer</u>. The brightness of the LED was controlled by pulse width modulation. The effectiveness of the system was shown by the new ability to image 10-100 micrometer water droplets travelling at 10 meters per second.</p>
